## Global Project: Alpha Research in the Aerospace Sector (US and European Equity Markets)

This project focuses on identifying alpha in the aerospace sector within the equity asset class across US and European markets

The multi-strategy approach consists of two distinct alpha signals:
- **A fundamental alpha** with an annual frequency (initially intended to be monthly, but due to limited data, the signal is currently annual)
- **A daily alpha** with a daily frequency

Using these two signals, I design and implement three investment strategies:
- **Long Only**
- **Long/Short Symmetrical**
- **Threshold Strategy**

Finally, I backtest these strategies and assess their performance using five key indicators:
- Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
- Sharpe Ratio
- Maximum Drawdown
- Alpha
- Information Ratio
